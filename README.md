### Additional Features Implemented in this App:
- **Player Color Customization:**  The app now supports custom color selection for players.
- **Group Division via Color:** Players can be organized into groups, visually differentiated by color, which facilitates new strategic team configurations. Simply pick a color from the dropdown options next to a player. For e.g. use the color differentiation to show
    + Permanent and rotating player positions
    + Strong and weak player differentiation
- **Addition of Refresh/Reset Button:** A button for refreshing or resetting has been integrated.
- **User Experience and Color System Enhancements:** Improvements have been made to the overall user experience and the color selection/display system.
